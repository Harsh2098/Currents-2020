          <p>
          Blockchain is a technology in which transfer of crypto currency is involved. For example: Bitcoin.<br> If energy is replaced with cryptocurrency, it will become Energy Blockchain. The duration is three weeks.<br> The final outcome will be an android app which serves as a platform to manage energy blockchain<br> but in a short term internship stage, the student may not reach that level. At least he/she may make a model<br> which could be extended later.Preferably 4 students who are good at coding.<br> Go through this link for prelimenary read : <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/microgrids-wired-energy" target="_blank">https://www.wired.co.uk/article/microgrids-wired-energy</a>

        <p>
          Electricity is the most important for industry, institutions or households. During transmission<br> of the electric energy there are many external factors that can impair the quality of energy supplied. <br>It is very important to identify the source of problems with the quality of electricity and in the case<br> of an internal source of low-quality supply, it is necessary to take corrective action. The electromagnetic<br> phenomena can describe by different attributes such as typical voltage level, specific frequency spectrum<br> or time duration of electromagnetic phenomena. An important and primary task is to analyze the power quality<br> and determine the problem. This can be accomplished by an instrument called the power quality analyzer<br> that measures and determine the electric parameters.

          Duration: 50 – 60 days

        <p>It is mandatory for a power engineer to know how much the amount of power a power plant generates<br> and also the usage by the customer over a period of time. In the existing power utility set up, consumers<br> are presented with usage information only once a month with their bill. The length of time between updates<br> about power usage is far too long for a consumer to observe a changed behavior’s effect on power usage.<br> In addition utility bills can be convoluted in how they present usage information, and a consumer may not be<br> able to decipher changes in their power usage from the last bill. The goal of providing detailed daily data<br> and most consumable load will help to optimize and reduce the power consumption of a load.<br>
        Duration: 50 – 60 days
